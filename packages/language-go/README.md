# Go language support in Pulsar

Adds syntax highlighting and snippets to Go files in Pulsar.

Originally [converted](https://pulsar-edit.dev/docs/launch-manual/sections/core-hacking/#converting-from-textmate) from the [Go TextMate bundle](https://github.com/rsms/Go.tmbundle).

Contributions are greatly appreciated. Please fork this repository and open a pull request to add snippets, make grammar tweaks, etc.
