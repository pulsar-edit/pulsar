# CSS language support in Pulsar

Adds syntax highlighting, completions, and snippets to CSS files in Pulsar.

from the [CSS TextMate bundle](https://github.com/textmate/css.tmbundle).

Contributions are greatly appreciated. Please fork this repository and open a
pull request to add snippets, make grammar tweaks, etc.
