# Plain text support in Pulsar

Grammar and snippets for plain text files in Pulsar.

Originally [converted](https://pulsar-edit.dev/docs/launch-manual/sections/core-hacking/#converting-from-textmate)
from the [Text TextMate bundle](https://github.com/textmate/text.tmbundle).

Contributions are greatly appreciated. Please fork this repository and open a
pull request to add snippets, make grammar tweaks, etc.
