# Ruby on Rails language support in Pulsar

Adds syntax highlighting and snippets to Rails files in Pulsar.

Originally [converted](https://pulsar-edit.dev/docs/launch-manual/sections/core-hacking/#converting-from-textmate) from the [Ruby on Rails TextMate bundle](https://github.com/drnic/ruby-on-rails-tmbundle).

Contributions are greatly appreciated. Please fork this repository and open a pull request to add snippets, make grammar tweaks, etc.
