# Sass/SCSS language support in Pulsar

Adds syntax highlighting and snippets to Sass/SCSS files in Pulsar.

Originally [converted](https://pulsar-edit.dev/docs/launch-manual/sections/core-hacking/#converting-from-textmate) from the [Sass TextMate bundle](https://github.com/alexsancho/SASS.tmbundle).

Contributions are greatly appreciated. Please fork this repository and open a pull request to add snippets, make grammar tweaks, etc.
