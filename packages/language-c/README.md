# C/C++ language support in Pulsar

Adds syntax highlighting and snippets to C/C++ files in Pulsar.

Originally [converted](https://pulsar-edit.dev/docs/launch-manual/sections/core-hacking/#converting-from-textmate)
from the [C TextMate bundle](https://github.com/textmate/c.tmbundle).

Contributions are greatly appreciated. Please fork this repository and open a
pull request to add snippets, make grammar tweaks, etc.
