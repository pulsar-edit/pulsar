# TypeScript language support in Pulsar

Adds syntax highlighting and snippets for TypeScript in Pulsar.

The grammar is the [Microsoft TypeScript TextMate grammar](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript-TmLanguage) and copied here on a semi-regular basis.  Any issues relating to syntax highlighting are likely to be there.
